description: This is the dataset for the paper "Mapping model units to visual neurons
  reveals population code for social behavior" from Cowley et al., 2024. It contains
  459 fruit fly courtship sessions, where 23 different LC neuron types have been silenced
  in male fruit flies.  The data comprise raw camera recordings, processed SLEAP joint
  position tracks, song labels, male behavior, and reconstructed stimuli. The dataset
  also contains calcium imaging data of male flies for 5 different LC neuron types,
  including raw TIF images and processed dF/F responses.

studyTarget:
- We asked which visual projection (or LC) neuron types contributed to a male fruit
  fly's courtship behavior. We silenced 23 different LC types individually and observed
  courtship behavior between a pair of male and female fruit flies. We also recorded
  from 5 different LC types of male fruit flies with calcium imaging.
